Servo Motor with Arduino Uno – Demonstration

This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an Arduino Uno. The servo moves between 0°, 90°, and 180° with delays, showing how easily we can control angular position using Arduino code.

Working Principle

A servo motor receives a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal from the Arduino, which defines the angle of rotation. By changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the servo rotates to the desired angle.

At 0° → Servo points to the initial position.

At 90° → Servo moves to the middle position.

At 180° → Servo rotates fully.

Code Used

The code moves the servo step-by-step between 0°, 90°, and 180°, with delays in between.
